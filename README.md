## About The Project

In this project, we used a dataset containing ex-college football players' game
stats and the round and pick in which they were drafted. After cleaning and
feature engineering the data, we trained a variety of models to predict what
round a player would get drafted at in the NFL draft based on their attributes
and statistics.
